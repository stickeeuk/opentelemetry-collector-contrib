# Mandatory: One or more tracking issues related to the change. You can use the PR number here if no issue exists.
issues: [36163]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.

# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.
subtext:
  Limit the bulk request size to roughly `flush::bytes` for sync bulk indexer.
  Sync bulk indexer is used when `batcher::enabled` is either true or false. In order words, sync bulk indexer is not used when batcher config is undefined.
  Change `flush::bytes` to always measure in uncompressed bytes.
  Change default `batcher::max_size_items` to `0` as bulk request size limit is now more effectively enforced by `flush::bytes`.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
